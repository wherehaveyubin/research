## üìç Overview

My research primarily focuses on spatial accessibility and human mobility to understand and improve urban systems.  
This repository is organized by research topic, with each section linking to relevant project folders and publications.

<br/>

## 1. üò∑ COVID-19 Medical Accessibility in Korea

Analysis of accessibility to beds in Negative Pressure Isolation Room (NPIR) in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon using 2SFCA and E2SFCA.

| Year | Project | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2021 | [Master‚Äôs Thesis](./2021-masters-thesis) | 2SFCA analysis of isolation facility access and GWR on confirmed case building types in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon, South Korea. |
| 2023 | [Updated Accessibility Analysis (Seoul)](./2023-Accessibility-to-Isolation-Beds-in-Seoul) | Enhanced E2SFCA with updated data. |

<br/>

## 2. üè• Healthcare Accessibility using Credit Card and Mobile Phone Data

Accessibility to nighttime hospitals on weekdays and weekends using E2SFCA and multi-source mobility data (card + telecom) in Seoul and Gyeongbuk, South Korea.

| Year | Project | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2024 | [JKST Paper Code](./2024-JKST) | Analyzed regional disparities in night-time hospital accessibility using mobility data and the E2SFCA method. |

<br/>

## 3. üö≤ Urban Mobility and Bike-Sharing in the US

Analysis of shared bike usage in Austin, Texas using community detection, 2SFCA, and GWR.

| Year | Project | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 2025 | [MetroBike Study](./2025-MetroBike) | Evaluated shared bike usage patterns and accessibility across Census Block Groups (CBGs) in Austin, Texas. |
