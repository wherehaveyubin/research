## üìç Overview

My research primarily focuses on spatial accessibility and human mobility to understand and improve urban systems.  
This repository is organized by research topic, with each section linking to relevant project folders and publications.

<br/>

## 1. üò∑ COVID-19 Medical Accessibility in Korea

Analysis of accessibility to negative pressure isolation beds in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon using 2SFCA and E2SFCA.

| Year | Project | Description |
